# Weather App
 Here's your weekly forecast!
 Use the search bar to grab weather data about your city. It will give you the current weather and a 5-day forecast.

# Technologies Used
+ HTML
+ JavaScript
+ jQuery
+ AJAX
+ OpenWeatherMap API
+ Bootstrap

# Project Notes
## Gimme the Goods!
+ It was fairly easy to use jQuery to target the DOM and manipulate it
+ Bootstrap made quick styling for a rough design easy without having to use any CSS
+ AJAX requests to OpenWeatherMap API provided data that was easy to manupulate using JavaScript methods
+ JavaScript can convert dates to Day names

## Leave some Bads :c
 + If I messed up with calling data from the API then I would be blocked for some time from doing so
 + jQuery...
 + + doesn't like allowing generated buttons to have onClick functions
 + + has some weird events with enter refreshing the page (I disabled the enter key so it wouldn't)

# Final Touches
If I were to finish this project, I would... 
 + Utilize the local store so that data from API calls are saved from recent searches. 
 + Add pictures for cloudy, sunny, rainy
 + Convert time from 24hr to 12hr
 + Start page with your location weather data filled out when arriving
